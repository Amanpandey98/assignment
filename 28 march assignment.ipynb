    "Ridge regression is a regularization technique that is used to mitigate the problem of overfitting in linear regression models. It is similar to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but it includes a regularization term that penalizes the magnitudes of the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OLS regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted values and the actual values. However, in Ridge regression, an additional penalty term is added to the objective function that penalizes the magnitudes of the regression coefficients. This penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding this penalty term to the objective function, Ridge regression shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, reducing the variance of the estimates at the expense of a small increase in bias. This regularization helps to prevent overfitting in cases where the number of predictors is large compared to the number of observations or when the predictors are highly correlated with each other"

    "2. Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation does not depend on the value of any other observation.\n",

    "1. Cross-validation: A common method for selecting the optimal value of lambda is to use cross-validation. The dataset is split into k-folds, with k-1 folds used for training the model and the remaining fold used for testing. This process is repeated k times, with each fold used once for testing. The average error across all folds is calculated for each value of lambda, and the lambda that minimizes the error is selected as the optimal value.\n",

    "3. Analytical solution: In some cases, the optimal value of lambda can be calculated analytically using the properties of the dataset and the Ridge regression equation. This method is less commonly used but can be useful in cases where the dataset is small and simple."
