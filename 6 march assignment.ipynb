However, if we want to compare the relative difference between the two groups for income, we cannot use ratios since there is no true zero point. On the other hand, ratios can be used for age."

    "Descriptive statistics involves the collection, analysis, and presentation of data to describe and summarize the main features of a dataset. It focuses on describing the characteristics of a sample or population, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (histograms, scatterplots, etc.). Descriptive statistics are used to gain insights into the data and to communicate the findings to others. For example, calculating the mean and standard deviation of test scores in a class and presenting them in a histogram can provide a visual summary of the data distribution and help to identify any trends or outliers.\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involves using sample data to make generalizations or predictions about a larger population. It involves statistical hypothesis testing, estimation, and prediction based on probability theory. Inferential statistics allow researchers to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. For example, a researcher may use inferential statistics to test whether there is a significant difference in test scores between two groups of students. This can help to identify whether the difference observed in the sample is likely to be a true difference or just due to chance."

    "Measures of central tendency are used to identify a single value that represents the typical or central value of the dataset. The most common measures of central tendency include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mean: The mean is the average of all the values in a dataset. It is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme values or outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset of test scores for a class of students, we can calculate the mean to get an idea of the typical score for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in order. It is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean.\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset of salaries for a company, we can calculate the median to get an idea of the typical salary earned by employees in the company.\n",

    "3.Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is useful when the data has a clear peak or most common value.\n",

    "1.Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives a rough indication of how much the data is spread out.\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset of heights of students in a class, we can calculate the range to get an idea of how much the heights vary.\n",
