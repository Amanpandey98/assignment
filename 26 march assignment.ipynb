    "- Simple linear regression involves analyzing the relationship between two variables, where one is the independent variable and the other is the dependent variable.

We would collect data on the heights and weights of a sample of individuals, plot the data on a scatterplot, and use a linear equation to determine the line of best fit.\n",

    "The main assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables should be linear. This means that the relationship between the variables can be expressed as a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Independence: The errors should be independent of each other. This means that the value of one error should not be dependent on the value of another error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The errors should be normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the residuals should be approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: There should be no high correlation among the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform several diagnostic tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Residual plots: You can create a scatterplot of the residuals against the fitted values. If the points are randomly scattered around zero, then the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions are likely to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normality tests: You can perform a normality test on the residuals. The most common test is the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the normality assumption is likely to hold.\n",

    "3. Durbin-Watson test: This test is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals. If the test statistic is close to 2, then there is no autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. VIF test: This test is used to detect multicollinearity among the independent variables. A VIF value greater than 5 indicates high multicollinearity."

    "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the error or loss function of a machine learning model.

    "The basic idea of gradient descent is to take steps in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function. The \"gradient\" is the vector of partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each of the model's parameters. By computing the gradient of the loss function, we can determine the direction in which the parameters should be updated in order to minimize the loss function. The magnitude of the gradient vector represents the slope of the loss function and the direction of the gradient vector represents the direction in which the function is decreasing.\n",

    "In gradient descent, the algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters and updates them iteratively by taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient. The step size is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate, which determines the size of the steps taken in each iteration. A larger learning rate can lead to faster convergence but can also cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum, while a smaller learning rate can lead to slower convergence but a more precise minimum.\n",

By minimizing the loss function, the model can learn to make accurate predictions on new data"

    "Multicollinearity is a common issue in multiple linear regression that arises when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other.

    "To detect multicollinearity, one can calculate the correlation matrix between all the independent variables in the model. A high correlation coefficient between two or more variables indicates a strong linear relationship between them, which may suggest the presence of multicollinearity. Another way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each independent variable in the model. VIF measures the extent to which a variable is explained by the other variables in the model, and a high VIF value (>5 or 10) suggests the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
