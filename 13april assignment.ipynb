This helps to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model"

Ensemble vs. Single Tree: The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust predictive model, while Decision Tree Regressor uses a single decision tree to make predictions.\n",

Overfitting: Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting than Decision Tree Regressor because it uses random feature selection and bootstrap sampling to train multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data.
