    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that involves using sample data to make inferences about a population. The goal of estimation is to estimate one or more unknown population parameters, such as the population mean or proportion, using the information obtained from a sample of data.\n",
    "There are two types of estimates in estimation statistics: point estimates and interval estimates.\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, and the sample proportion is a point estimate of the population proportion. Point estimates are often used when a single value is required, such as in decision making.\n",
    "Interval estimates, on the other hand, provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would provide a range of values within which the true population mean is likely to fall with 95% confidence. Interval estimates are useful when we want to be more precise about the estimate and need to communicate the level of uncertainty in the estimate"

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a statement or assumption about a population parameter is likely to be true or false based on sample data. In hypothesis testing, we start by stating a null hypothesis, which is a statement about the population that we assume to be true. We then collect sample data and use statistical tests to calculate the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the one we observed, given the null hypothesis. If this probability is very low, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that our sample data provides evidence in favor of an alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is used to make decisions based on data, such as whether to approve a new drug based on clinical trial results or whether to reject a null hypothesis in a scientific study. It is a powerful tool for testing theories and evaluating evidence, and it helps to ensure that decisions are made based on sound statistical principles rather than intuition or speculation.\n",

By using hypothesis testing, we can determine whether our sample data provides enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis and support an alternative hypothesis, or whether the observed results are likely due to chance."
