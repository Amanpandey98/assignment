While this reduction can simplify the data and improve efficiency, it may discard subtle patterns or fine-grained information that could be relevant for certain tasks.\n",

A model with insufficient complexity may struggle to capture the intricacies and nuances present in the data, resulting in a poor fit and limited predictive power.\n",

    "Variance Retained: One common approach is to examine the amount of variance retained by each reduced dimension. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provide variance ratios or explained variance for each principal component. By analyzing the cumulative explained variance, you can choose the number of dimensions that capture a significant portion (e.g., 95% or 99%) of the total variance. This approach ensures that you retain most of the important information while reducing dimensionality"
