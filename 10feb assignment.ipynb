    "Saving changes: If changes have been made to the file, the close() function ensures that they are saved before the file is closed.\n",

    "Freeing resources: When a file is opened, system resources are allocated to handle it. If a file is not closed, these resources may not be released, which can lead to performance issues.\n",
