The weak models are trained to minimize the loss function through gradient descent. The final prediction is obtained by summing the predictions of all weak models, where each model corrects the residuals or errors of the previous models.\n",

    "Improved Performance: Increasing the number of estimators typically leads to improved performance, especially in the initial stages of boosting. Adding more weak models allows the ensemble to capture more complex patterns and make more accurate predictions. The ensemble becomes more expressive and has a higher capacity to fit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Bias: As the number of estimators increases, the ensemble model becomes less biased. Initially, with a small number of estimators, the ensemble might underfit the training data. However, as more weak models are added, the ensemble's ability to capture complex relationships and fit the data improves, reducing bias.\n",

    "Potential Overfitting: Increasing the number of estimators beyond a certain point can lead to overfitting. The ensemble may start to memorize the training data, becoming too specialized and losing generalization ability. This can result in a decrease in performance on unseen data, as the model becomes overly complex and sensitive to noise and outliers in the training set."
