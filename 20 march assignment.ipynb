    "Nominal encoding is a type of data encoding technique used in data science to transform categorical data into numerical values. It is also known as one-hot encoding or dummy coding. In nominal encoding, each unique value in a categorical variable is assigned a unique numerical value, such as 0 or 1.\n",

    "For example, suppose we have a dataset containing information about different types of fruits, such as apple, banana, and orange. We can use nominal encoding to convert the categorical variable \"fruit type\" into numerical values. We can create a new binary variable for each unique value in the \"fruit type\" variable. Each binary variable will have a value of 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding value is present in the original variable. For instance, if an entry has the \"apple\" value in the \"fruit type\" variable, the corresponding binary variable will have a value of 1 in the \"apple\" column and 0 in the \"banana\" and \"orange\" columns."

    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the number of unique values in a categorical variable is high, and the frequency of each value is relatively even.

Nominal encoding can also preserve some of the information about the frequency of each value in the variable, which can be useful in some cases.\n",

In this case, the type of cuisine variable may have many unique values, such as Italian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and so on. One-hot encoding would create a binary variable for each unique value, resulting in a large number of binary variables. Nominal encoding, on the other hand, would assign a unique numerical value to each unique value in the variable, such as 1 for Italian, 2 for Chinese, and so on.
