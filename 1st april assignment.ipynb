    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both popular statistical models used for analyzing data, but they are used for different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a method for modeling the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used when the dependent variable is continuous and the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is assumed to be linear. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its size, number of rooms, and location is a scenario where linear regression would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, logistic regression is a method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome (i.e., a Yes/No or 1/0 outcome) based on one or more independent variables. It is used when the dependent variable is binary or categorical, and the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is assumed to be logistic. For example, predicting whether a customer will buy a product or not based on their demographic information and past purchase history is a scenario where logistic regression would be appropriate."

L1 regularization adds the absolute value of the coefficients to the cost function, while L2 regularization adds the square of the coefficients.

    "1. Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when there is high correlation among the independent variables in the logistic regression model. This can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the coefficients. One way to address multicollinearity is to remove one of the correlated variables from the model. Another approach is to use regularization techniques, such as ridge regression or Lasso regression, which can help reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the model.\n",
