    "GET and POST are two HTTP methods used in client-server communication to exchange data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a web server). Here's an explanation of both:\n",
    "GET:\n",
    "The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server. When a client sends a GET request, it sends a request for a specific resource, and the server responds by sending back the requested data. The data is usually sent in the form of a URL query string that contains key-value pairs.\n",
    "POST:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to the server. When a client sends a POST request, it sends data in the request body to the server. This data can be in the form of text, JSON, XML, or binary data, and is used to create or update a resource on the server"
