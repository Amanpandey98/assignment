    "Problem: A doctor wants to determine the probability that a patient has a certain disease based on the patient's symptoms. The prevalence of the disease in the general population is 5%, and the test for the disease is 95% accurate (meaning it correctly identifies 95% of people who have the disease and 5% of people who do not have the disease). If the patient tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",

    "Let's define the events as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A: the patient has the disease\n",
    "B: the patient tests positive for the disease\n",
    "We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the patient has the disease given a positive test result.\n",

    "First, we need to calculate the prior probability of the patient having the disease, P(A). We are told that the prevalence of the disease in the general population is 5%, so:\n",

    "P(B|not A) = 0.05\n",
