    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in K-nearest neighbors (KNN) lies in the way they measure the distance or dissimilarity between data points. This difference can have an impact on the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. Here's a breakdown of the differences and their effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "- Definition: Euclidean distance is calculated as the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It measures the length of the direct path between two points.\n",
    "- Formula: For two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) in a 2D space, the Euclidean distance is given by √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²).\n",
    "- Characteristics: Euclidean distance takes into account both the magnitude and direction of the differences between coordinates. It treats all dimensions equally and assumes that the relationship between features is isotropic (uniform in all directions).\n",
    "- Impact on KNN: Euclidean distance tends to work well when the underlying data distribution is spherical or isotropic. It is more sensitive to changes in feature magnitudes and can be affected by features with larger scales dominating the distance calculations. Therefore, feature scaling is important when using Euclidean distance in KNN to ensure fair comparisons between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance:\n",
    "- Definition: Manhattan distance, also known as city block distance or L1 distance, measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of two points. It measures the distance traveled along the axes to reach from one point to another, forming a path similar to moving through city blocks.\n",
    "- Formula: For two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) in a 2D space, the Manhattan distance is given by |x₂ - x₁| + |y₂ - y₁|.\n",
    "- Characteristics: Manhattan distance considers only the magnitude of differences between coordinates, ignoring the direction. It assumes movement is restricted to axis-aligned paths and does not account for diagonal movements.\n",
    "- Impact on KNN: Manhattan distance is useful when the relationship between features is better captured by axis-aligned paths, such as in grid-like structures. It is less sensitive to changes in feature scales compared to Euclidean distance. However, it can be affected by differences in feature ranges, and features with larger ranges may dominate the distance calculations. Feature scaling can still be beneficial to ensure fair comparisons between features.\n"

    "Effect on Performance: Euclidean distance works well when the underlying data distribution is spherical or isotropic.

It assumes that all dimensions are equally important and that the relationship between features is isotropic (uniform in all directions). However, it is sensitive to changes in feature magnitudes and can be influenced by features with larger scales dominating the distance calculations.\n",
    "Situations for Usage: Euclidean distance is commonly used when all features have comparable scales, and the relationship between features is assumed to be isotropic. It is appropriate for continuous and numeric data, such as measurements or physical attributes.\n",

    "Number of Neighbors (k): The number of neighbors to consider for classification or regression. A higher value of k can provide a smoother decision boundary but may lead to more biased predictions. A lower value of k can result in more flexible boundaries but may increase sensitivity to noise. Tuning k involves finding the right balance between bias and variance. Cross-validation and grid search can help identify the optimal value.\n",

    "Weighting Scheme: In weighted KNN, the contributions of neighbors are weighted based on their distance. Common weighting schemes include uniform weighting (equal contribution) and distance weighting (inversely proportional to distance).

    "Computational Complexity: KNN can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces. As the size of the dataset grows, the time required for nearest neighbor search increases. One way to address this issue is to use approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms or employ dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.\n",

    "Curse of Dimensionality: KNN performance can deteriorate as the number of dimensions (features) increases. This is known as the curse of dimensionality. It occurs because, in high-dimensional spaces, data points become increasingly sparse, making it challenging to find meaningful nearest neighbors. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or feature selection methods can help alleviate this problem by reducing the number of dimensions to more relevant and informative features."
