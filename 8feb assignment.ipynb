    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. The goal of abstraction is to simplify the complexity of a system by hiding the underlying details and presenting a clear and concise interface to the users.\n",

When a user interacts with an ATM machine, they don't need to know about the internal details of how the machine connects to the bank's database or how it verifies the user's identity. Instead, the user only interacts with the essential features of the ATM machine, such as entering a card, entering a pin, and withdrawing cash."
